    <h2>Bank On Atlanta Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Bank On is a national program managed by the Cities for Financial Empowerment.
        It is a comprehensive strategy to bring unbanked and under-banked residents into the financial mainstream. 
        With the goal of helping families lay their financial foundation, the City of Atlanta will launch its own program later this year-Bank On Atlanta. 
        In partnership with local financial institutions and community organizations, Bank On Atlanta will provide practical financial skills that will enable 
        residents and small businesses to better manage their finances and plan for their future.
        We will also provide increased access to low-cost personal and business accounts and services, as well as ongoing, high quality financial education 
        and one-on-one individualized financial coaching. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We understand that solid financial advice along with access to mainstream financial services is critical to economic success. 
        This initiative is a pivotal step forward in improving the financial health of Atlanta's residents.

    <h2>Why Is It Important to Have A Bank Account?</h2>
    <p>
        Research shows that relying on alternative financial service providers, such as check-cashing or payday lending establishments,
        make it hard for residents to rise out of poverty in our city.Â  The fees from these non-traditional establishments force 
        individuals and families to pay to access their own hard-earned money, pay their bills, and complete basic financial transactions.
        Without access to mainstream financial services, the average unbanked worker spends an estimated $40,000 throughout his or her
        lifetime simply to cash their paychecks1. Additionally, individuals who rely on such establishments are unable to build credit 
        history. By establishing relationships with financial institutions, people can grow from financially insecure to financially stable; 
        and ultimately, open doors to a range of asset building opportunities such as homeownership, the development of a stronger credit score, or starting a business.

        Bank On Atlanta will ensure that residents have the necessary resources to manage their finances effectively. 
        The program will also help participants become more aware of the economic risks and growth opportunities that having a bank account provides.
