# What is BankOnAtlanta?

> Bank On is a national program managed by the Cities for Financial Empowerment. It is a comprehensive strategy to bring unbanked and under-banked residents into the financial mainstream. With the goal of helping families lay their financial foundation, the City of Atlanta will launch its own program later this year-Bank On Atlanta. In partnership with local financial institutions and community organizations, Bank On Atlanta will provide practical financial skills that will enable residents and small businesses to better manage their finances and plan for their future.Â  We will also provide increased access to low-cost personal and business accounts and services, as well as ongoing, high quality financial education and one-on-one individualized financial coaching.

The [BankOnAtlanta website](http://bankonatlanta.org) (this repo) serves as a online resource where individuals may find services or information provided by the City of Atlanta and its partners.


## Technology Stack
- [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) - Mostly used for the responsive views, may be swapped out later
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Currently there are no backend services - all the calls and changes to the views are done in the frontend. The project is in its early stages so the technologies used may change depending on what the needs are.
